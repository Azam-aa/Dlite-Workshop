# Dlite-Workshop
Welcome to the GetUp Counter repository! In this repository, you will find three Python programs that were covered during our delightful workshop. These programs are designed to perform various tasks related to photo capturing, video capturing, and face recognition.

Programs
video_capture.py: With this program, you can capture videos using your webcam. It leverages the webcam functionality to record video footage and save it to your computer. You can use it to create short videos or capture moments in motion.

face_recognition.py: This program focuses on face recognition. By uploading a photo, this program uses simple algorithms to detect and recognize faces within the image. It's an exciting feature that can help you identify people in photos or even verify their identity.

photo.py: This program allows you to upload photos in python. It's a great tool for capturing quick snapshots.
